### comparison between Flat File Systems and Relational Databases

|                    | Flat File Systems                              | Relational Databases                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Data Structure     | Simple file that stores data in a single table | Structured data stored in multiple related tables   |
| Data Redundancy    | High redundancy, as data is often duplicated   | Low redundancy, as data is normalized across tables |
| Relationships      | No relationships between data                  | Relationships established through foreign keys      |
| Example Usage      | Small datasets, simple applications            | Large datasets, complex applications                |
| Drawbacks          | Limited querying, data integrity issues        | More complex setup, requires knowledge of SQL       |
