| Non Relational    | Instagram | Large-scale data storage, flexibility |
| Relational        | Uber      | Transactional data, complex queries   |
| Non Relational    | Uber      | Scalability, flexibility              |
| Relational        | Amazon    | Transactional data, complex queries   |
| Non Relational    | Amazon    | Scalability, high availability        |
